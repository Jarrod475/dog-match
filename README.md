### DOG TILE MATCHING GAME!

#what is it?
This is a tile matching memory game that grabs images from a dog API and uses them to create 2 tiles in a random order of each dog picture.

The user can determine how many matching pairs there should be in the grid to make the game easer or harder.


#what did i learn from this? 
1. States in React, when changed force the entire component to reload.
2. You can feed a component a random number (I called it a seed in Tilebox.js) and then use   hooks to determine if the component should update or not. I dont know if this was the best way to do it. but it was the only way i got it working after many different solutions.
3. You can use "Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));" to create a delay in your program. kind of like 'wait(10)'
4. videogame programming logic is x100 times easier than this...
